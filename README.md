# RecipeApp
I created my own api service with .net core and rendered it to my React native app.

For run api go to api directory and run this:dotnet run
For run the application go to api directory and run this:npx react-native start
For ios make this api address:"http://localhost:5070/recipe"
For Android make this api address:"http://10.0.2.2:5070/recipe/"
